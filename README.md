# InfoViz-2024
Info visualization project done by Drobnitchi Daniel-Nicusor and Suto Robert Lucian

The project is based on the following datasets, taken from kaggle:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickzel/flight-delay-and-cancellation-dataset-2019-2023/data?select=flights_sample_3m.csv

They represents flight data from over 8 companies, containing 32 columns of information with varying utility.

The project contains a POWER Bi report and a jupyter notebook file.

Due to the fact that the POWER BI report was too large of a file, the added report contains half the data (which might mean it might miss some information). The presentation will be done using the entire dataset.
